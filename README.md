# Bat_Ball_Stump_Game
This game is similar to the ROCK PAPER & SCISSOR game. I have been created using HTML/CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
Steps to play this game:
1. Open the game
2. In this game there are two players 1st is the user and the second one is the Machine itself.
3. The machine will make its choice randomly, User will make his/her choice itself.
   Result:
  The result will be based on the following:
   1. If Player1's(User) and Machine's choice is the same then only the result will be "TIE"
   2. If player1 chooses BAT and the player2 chooses BALL then the player1 will "WIN" and vice-versa
   3. If player1 chooses BALL and the player2 chooses STUMP then the player1 will "WIN" and vice-versa.

ENJOY THE GAME!!
